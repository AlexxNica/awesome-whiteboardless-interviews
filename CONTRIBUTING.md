# Contribution Guidelines

Thanks for stopping by to contribute to this list! :tada: Happy to have you here. :smile:

Please note that this project adheres to a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Criteria for adding a new company
- The company must not conduct whiteboarding interviews.
- The company must still assess technical skill in some way. If the company doesn't whiteboard, but instead just conducts regular behavioral / background interviews for its candidates, then alas, it won't make the list. :cry:
- You must be able to personally vouch for this company's interview process. This means that you either went through the interview process yourself as a candidate, or you work at the company and know first-hand how it works.
- The company must have a website.
- The company must have had a reasonable amount of press coverage from legitimate sources.
  - This list is meant to be a curated list of companies someone on the look for new jobs should feel secure applying to. It's really hard to verify the health of a company no one's heard of. :confused:
  - Although note that "legitimate" doesn't necessarily mean "mainstream" media â€“ this is a list for developers, after all! :wink:

## Adding a new company
Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous listings before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each listing.
- Additions should be added in alphabetical order.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace, but to keep a newline at the end of the file.
- The pull request should have a useful title and explain why the company should be included.

The listing should have the following format:

```
- [Company Name](link to company website): _What does the company do / make?_ What the company does instead of whiteboard interviews
```

Thanks again for taking the time to contribute! :raised_hands:
