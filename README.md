# Awesome Whiteboard-less Interviews
A curated list of awesome companies that test developer skills without whiteboard coding interviews! :sparkles:

Inspired by [Awesome Remote Job](https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job) and the rest of the [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

## What is a whiteboard coding interview?
A whiteboard interview is a style of interview a lot of companies use to test a developer's technical skill: solving programming problems in front of their interviewer(s), by writing code or pseudo-code (often on a literal whiteboard or blackboard, but this can be done over videoconferencing now too). These problems often test a developer's knowledge of algorithms, though they might also try to test something closer to "day-to-day" work.

## Why might someone want to find a company that doesn't do them?
